      <h1>Thoughts on depression pt.1</h1>
<p class="subtitle">October 27, 2021</p>

<p><em>Depressed</em> people (a party I joined long ago), are deeply convinced that nothing good can possibly really happen in their lives.
Or better: anything that <strong>they want</strong> to happen. <!--more--></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You and your girlfriend are really having a nice time. Wanna move in together? In the same house?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Oh please! For what? To spoil it? So that we will hate each other? God help me!</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mh, this girl you are talking with appears to be flirting with you. Why don’t you move it up into the bedroom?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>What!? Are you crazy? So that we have sex and I can disappoint everybody with my horrible performance and my neediness? I’d kill myself, that is a quicker and less painful way to disgrace.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, you got the number of the girl of your dreams. All you have to do is text her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Yea sure, that will go well. How did you just forgot that she will immediately sniff my insecurity? I will ruin everything as usual.</em></p>

<p>Yea, the focus here is on relationships, but you get the point.<br />
If you are depressed, you are convinced that all the good things are just out of your grasp, for one reason or another. The world has turned its back on you, and you are now part of the miserable bunch.</p>

<p>This way of thinking will inevitably get you exactly there: to an epic fail. Look, depressed people are just smart cows. All other cows, when crossing that mysterious door, will be butchered. Depressed cows know that, somehow, and stay behind the door to complain, lament and wait for time to save them from their horrible situation.<br />
They avoid being butchered, so they have some more time to stay afloat.</p>

<p>Without the strong feeling of every door is a butcher’s entrance, depressed people won’t be depressed. They know the worst is awaiting.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The next message you receive: yea, that girl is pissed with you and doesn’t want to talk to you anymore.</li>
  <li>The next day of your life: the same old shit, just getting slightly worst as time slowly passes by.</li>
  <li>The next choice you take: the wrong one, dictated by your infantile internal bullshit rather than adult rational beliefs.</li>
  <li>The next relationship you get in: one of you is going to be deadly unsatisfied and leave the other causing incredible pain.</li>
</ul>

<p>No wonder depressed people start to develop anger! Anger is the only feeling that makes any sense when it is clear that this game is rigged to make you a loser.</p>

<p>You are angry because you are playing a game (life) which is engineered sot that you, specifically, lose. <br />
You are angry because your effort and intentions do not matter, your internal mindfuck will always be one step ahead of you.</p>

<p>You are angry since the solution to all this is very simple and it is to, well, stop being depressed. To give up. To get into that door and be butchered. To make your girlfriend cry and slit her wrists, to being dumped because your girl has found a real man to give her orgasms, to make wrong fucking choices and be underpaid or unemployed at 35, to live, yet live, yet wake up, yet fucking go through another day, plow through another day of shitty life.</p>

<p>That’s it man, that’s what <strong><em>not</em></strong> being depressed is all about.
No wonder depressed people stay so! We don’t like to give up! We are quite tenacious actually, we really grip to this situation. <br />
Actually, the harder reality rains down on us with its non-sense and biased mechanics, the more we grasp and clamp our teeth.</p>

<p>I salute you, all depressed people.
You really suck.</p>
