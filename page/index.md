## Spoiler alert!
All what you will find here is terrible, depressive and oppressively dark.\\
This is depressed-people poetry. Yea, you heard me.\\
This is not the *"cool artist depression"* type or the *"I was sad but now I am fine"* kind of shit. This is the boring, childish, fucked-up *"oh my god she left me and now all I do is play WoW and jerk off to cock and ball torture"* type of poetry.

Take it or leave it.

## Random Thoughts
> *Joy is always new born. Pain is the same old wound.*

> *The negative stories of our life are for analizing. The positive ones, are for savouring*

> *Life is a leaf floating on a puddle of pain, gazing at a sky of joy*

## Poems

### Will you ever

Will you ever come back.. to me?\\
This waiting room of a life\\
I spill out everywhere and I can’t - yet - drink\\
I know I hurt you badly, make you cry\\
and even if now I can’t reach you with my voice\\
I can reach you with my mind, for here you still exist,\\
even tough outside you don’t.\\
You are so beautiful, can I just sit?\\
Do you know I got so lost?\\
It does not really matter, I still carry a picture in my heart.\\
Look at me, I am falling down, in the rain\\
Look at me I still smile, you know I like it when you look at me\\
Baby, could you make this life even emptier once you are in it?\\
Look, I don’t hate on you, for leaving, haha for hating\\
don’t mind really\\
don’t mind at all,\\
why should a man mind of the tallest mountain, when he already walked its highest peak?\\
just hug me baby, even if you don’t care\\
life is not much better at all, look, it’s all scattered out for you\\
I’m leaving you know, leaving you to this beautiful brunch with your friends\\
I have a very long walk awaiting, in which I can think of you\\
and I will sing:\\
*“meet me on the other side,\\
where as a rose I will wake …”*

### My Little Golden Dawn

Everything in my life runs the same old way, the same old way\\
of when you left me\\
I can’t really hate it, can’t really change it\\
I might as well, just start to like it\\
you know I would throw it all way for you, I would throw myself \\
I don’t care to move on.\\
When the catastrophe is real only the foolish move on,\\
the wise mourn. \\
My place is in mourning, it feels so right,\\
I mourn for the world has lost its star,\\
its redeeming star, that would make it all turn and squeal \\
you would make the whole world turn and squeal\\
because you were all that the world needed\\
you knew all that the world shut up to listen to \\
I was just waiting for your miracle, baby\\
I was just waiting for you to become the dawn \\
if you still cry you can come here in my arms, you know \\
anytime I will hold my little golden dawn \\
anything she is tired or sorry\\
or wasted or empty \\
anytime she does not need to ask \\
anytime I can carry you up\\
because you make the world go round \\
am I so sick am I, so sick to love you \\
don’t worry babe, everything is going to be alright \\
I will make it alright \\
because you are beautiful and only the cruelest of worlds, only the most treacherous of people will not love you.\\
it does not matter, if we have to close in\\
shut off the light\\
turn off the life \\
it does not matter baby we can run from it me and you\\
we can run if they don’t love you\\
it’s not your fault \\
I will be your last bunker romance if needs be.
