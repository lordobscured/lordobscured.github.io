      <h1>Poetry & Thoughts</h1>
<p class="subtitle"></p>

<h2 id="spoiler-alert">Spoiler alert!</h2>
<p>All what you will find here is terrible, depressive and oppressively dark.<br />
This is depressed-people poetry. Yea, you heard me.<br />
This is not the <em>“cool artist depression”</em> type or the <em>“I was sad but now I am fine”</em> kind of shit. This is the boring, childish, fucked-up <em>“oh my god she left me and now all I do is play WoW and jerk off to cock and ball torture”</em> type of poetry.</p>

<p>Take it or leave it.</p>

<h2 id="random-thoughts">Random Thoughts</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Joy is always new born. Pain is the same old wound.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The negative stories of our life are for analizing. The positive ones, are for savouring</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Life is a leaf floating on a puddle of pain, gazing at a sky of joy</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="will-you-ever">Will you ever</h3>

<p>Will you ever come back.. to me?<br />
This waiting room of a life<br />
I spill out everywhere and I can’t - yet - drink<br />
I know I hurt you badly, make you cry<br />
and even if now I can’t reach you with my voice<br />
I can reach you with my mind, for here you still exist,<br />
even tough outside you don’t.<br />
You are so beautiful, can I just sit?<br />
Do you know I got so lost?<br />
It does not really matter, I still carry a picture in my heart.<br />
Look at me, I am falling down, in the rain<br />
Look at me I still smile, you know I like it when you look at me<br />
Baby, could you make this life even emptier once you are in it?<br />
Look, I don’t hate on you, for leaving, haha for hating<br />
don’t mind really<br />
don’t mind at all,<br />
why should a man mind of the tallest mountain, when he already walked its highest peak?<br />
just hug me baby, even if you don’t care<br />
life is not much better at all, look, it’s all scattered out for you<br />
I’m leaving you know, leaving you to this beautiful brunch with your friends<br />
I have a very long walk awaiting, in which I can think of you<br />
and I will sing:<br />
<em>“meet me on the other side,<br />
where as a rose I will wake …”</em></p>

<h3 id="my-little-golden-dawn">My Little Golden Dawn</h3>

<p>Everything in my life runs the same old way, the same old way<br />
of when you left me<br />
I can’t really hate it, can’t really change it<br />
I might as well, just start to like it<br />
you know I would throw it all way for you, I would throw myself <br />
I don’t care to move on.<br />
When the catastrophe is real only the foolish move on,<br />
the wise mourn. <br />
My place is in mourning, it feels so right,<br />
I mourn for the world has lost its star,<br />
its redeeming star, that would make it all turn and squeal <br />
you would make the whole world turn and squeal<br />
because you were all that the world needed<br />
you knew all that the world shut up to listen to <br />
I was just waiting for your miracle, baby<br />
I was just waiting for you to become the dawn <br />
if you still cry you can come here in my arms, you know <br />
anytime I will hold my little golden dawn <br />
anything she is tired or sorry<br />
or wasted or empty <br />
anytime she does not need to ask <br />
anytime I can carry you up<br />
because you make the world go round <br />
am I so sick am I, so sick to love you <br />
don’t worry babe, everything is going to be alright <br />
I will make it alright <br />
because you are beautiful and only the cruelest of worlds, only the most treacherous of people will not love you.<br />
it does not matter, if we have to close in<br />
shut off the light<br />
turn off the life <br />
it does not matter baby we can run from it me and you<br />
we can run if they don’t love you<br />
it’s not your fault <br />
I will be your last bunker romance if needs be.</p>
