Finally!

Somewhere I can be depressed in peace!

Everywhere I go people try to console me for my depression, it's horrible! They meet me and start saying shit like:
* *"Hey, you are not that bad as you say you are!"*
* *"Why do you have such a bad opinion of yourself?"*
* *"You shouldn't be so hard on yourself!"*.

Look, dudes, I appreciate the effort, but what do you know?\\
I mean, you just met me, I, on the other hand, live in me.. what like fucking 24/7? 356 days a year?\\
I mean, I am an expert in myself. I know why I suck, precisely, I know very well the reasons to hate my life and myself.
Are you going just to assume a total different perspective after just meeting me for, what, 2 hours? Preposterous! Leave it to the expert!

I mean, it's not like I am being dangerous or whatever, my hatred is all internalized. I get to have the messed up mind of the psychopath without any of the advantages like the robbing, killing and being cool.

No sir, I just interalize all of the shit.

I am basically a psychopath killer without the killing, the being cool and the occasional chick that falls for this charm. I am not dangerous! I would not kill a single living person (well, maybe expect for [this guy](http://127.0.0.1:4000/lord-obscured/about/))!

I am here to lament, rant, be sad, and say all the shit that would get me compassionate looks, *"oohww"* sounds and pity hugs outside in the real world.

(Don't) **Enjoy!**

p.s. I suck at everything I do. So there is no way I could do this cool theme. I just took it from [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
